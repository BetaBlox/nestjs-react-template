# Nest / React / Prisma Template

This is our base project template for web applications, APIs, and administrative portals. The goal is to make starting a new app project simple, yet come with all the things we're accustomed to having on our projects - such as testing, utilities, deployment configurations, etc.

## Technologies

### Frontend

- [React](https://react.dev/) - Library for web and native user interfaces.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Local development server and build tooling for the fronend

### Backend

- [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) - MVC web application framework written in typescript
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Our database of choice
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - ORM for schema, db migrations, data relationships
- Docker - download [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) to help manage local dependencies

### Monorepo

- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) - A monorepo infrastructure incremental bundler and build system optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript.

### Miscellaneous

- [Git Patch Stack](https://git-ps.sh/) - Git Patch Stack is a command line tool that facilitates a Patch Stack based workflow with Git. Git Patch Stack helps you think in terms of a stack of patches instead of a series of isolated branches.
